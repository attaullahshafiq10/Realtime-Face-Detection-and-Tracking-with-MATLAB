# Realtime-Face-Detection-and-Tracking-with-MATLAB

Object detection and tracking are important in many computer vision applications including activity recognition, automotive safety, and surveillance. In this example I have developed a simple system for tracking a single face in a live video stream captured by a webcam. MATLAB provides webcam support through a Hardware Support Package, which will need to download and install in order to run this example. The support package is available via the Support Package Installer.

The face tracking system, in this example can be in one of two modes: detection or tracking. In the detection mode, can use object to detect a face in the current frame. If a face is detected, then must detect corner points on the face, and then switch to the tracking mode.
